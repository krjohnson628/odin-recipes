    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This tofu recipe requires an air fryer.  I use an add on for the Instant Pot. The tofu is great for fusion tacos, on salads, or even in quesadillas. It is great for vegans and non-vegans alike.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 10oz package of firm tofu (Hodo brand preferred)</li>
        <li>2 tbsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tbsp neutral high heat oil</li>
        <li>2 tsps sesame oil</li>
        <li>1.5 tsp garlic powder</li>
        <li>dash cayenne</li>
        <li>1 tsp umami powder (optional, but addds great flavor)</li>
        <li>pinch of salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut tofu open and drain.</li>
        <li>Cut tofu into 4 rows on the thin way and 6 rows on the wide way, creating 24 total tofu squares.</li>
        <li>Put tofus onto a cutting board covered by a paper towel folded in half. Cover the tofus in a paper towel folded in half and then put another cutting board on top of them. Put a weight on top of the cutting board. Press for 30 min - 2 hrs.</li>
        <li>Create a marinade by combining the soy sauce, oil, sesame oil, garlic powder, cayenne, and umami powder in a tupperware</li>
        <li>Add tofu to the marinade. Marinate for 10 minutes, flipping every few minutes.</li>
        <li>Add cornstarch to the marinade. Shake until saucy. <em>If it is chunky, add more soy sauce.</em></li>
        <li>Fry in the air fryer for 10-12 minutes, rotating halfway through.</li>
    </ol>
