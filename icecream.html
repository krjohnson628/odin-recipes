        <li>1 1/2 cups half & half</li>
        <li>1/3 cup brown sugar</li>

        <li>1 dark chocolate bar</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Crush graham crackers in their sleeve. I prefer some chunks and some finely ground pieces.</li>
        <li>Combine heavy whipping cream and brown sugar in a medium bowl until sugar crystals have dissolved.</li>
        <li>Add half & half, crushed graham cracker pieces, salt, and vanilla to the heavy whipping cream and sugar mixture. Stir until combined.</li>
        <li>Pour the mixture into the ice cream maker and churn about 20 minutes (follow the instructions on your machine).</li>
        <li>While ice cream is churning, break or cut the chocolate bar into the desired chunk size.</li>
        <li>When the ice cream has almost finished churning, add the chocolate chunks.</li>
        <li>Transfer ice cream to a container and cover. Freeze for about 4 hours before serving.</li>
